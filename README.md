# mannequin.js
A simple library of a model of articulated human figure. The shape of the figure
and its movements are done purely in JavaScript. The graphics is implemented in
[Three.js](threejs.org).

The library is used int the course "Fundamentals of Computer Graphics" for Computer
Sciences undergraduate students from the [Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics](https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en)
at [Sofia University](https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng).

This is the fourth incarnation of the human figure. The first one was implemented
in Elica. The second one was implemented in C/C++ and used OpenGL. The third one
was implemented in JS/Three.js.
