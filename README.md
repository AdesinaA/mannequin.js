This is the fourth incarnation of the human figure. The first one was implemented
in Elica. The second one was implemented in C/C++ and OpenGL. The third one
was implemented in JS/Three.js and is a direct predecessor of the current mannequin.js.

### Source code

The main library is `mannequin.js`. It requires `three.min.js`, which is also
included in this repository. There is no need to compile anything. See the
[live demos](https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/demos/demos.md) for examples how to use
